Minuscule client for the Github API
===================================

This library just provides the HTTP methods.
See https://developer.github.com/v3 for valid requests.

Alternatives
------------

* [`ghub+`](https://github.com/vermiculus/ghub-plus) is a wrapper
  around `ghub`, which provides functions for accessing specific
  end-points.

* [`gh`](https://github.com/sigma/gh.el) is a more heavy weight
  implementation which uses Eieio.

* [`glab`](https://gitlab.com/tarsius/glab) is to Gitlab what `ghub`
  is to Github.
